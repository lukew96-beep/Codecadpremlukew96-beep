<center><h2>By Luke Williamson</h2></center>
<p>In the mostly deserted area of Doswell, Virgina, Kings Dominoion, 
    now a massive themepark, started. It did not howeve, start as the normal conventional park. There was a time when 
the land filled with rollercoasters and screams was a wild safari adventure park and they took extreme measures
to insure interesting species. They were willing to go as far as it took.</p>

<h2>You CREATED WHAT?!</h2>
<p>The doctors in the biolab were there three hours earlier on January 15, 1975.
While the rest of the safari workers were at home these eager scientist were
playing god in a way that would have terrible consequences. A wolf sat on the 
operation table completely unaware of what was about to be done to it. Three other
wolves laid on obersevation tables to each side. Beside the observation tables
was the instructions for a wolf, dog hibrid. A cross between wolves and 
    routerilers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract blood from canine specimine</li>
<li> Spin blood in centrifuge for aproximately thirty seconds.</li>
<li>Inject blood into wolf species of exact blood type after adding 
three CCs of Adrenaline</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the scientists injected the first specimine and it imediately
    began to convulse uncontrollably. "We need 30 CCs of valium stat!", 
    shouted the frantic vet. In the rocking the button control for the 
    other spicimins got hit as well. "Great, hell! WHAT have we done?!"
